# Hi, I’m Thomas 👋

I work on software, mathematics, and systems-level models at the intersection of
computer science, economics, and machine intelligence.

This GitHub profile is a **central navigation point** for my public work.

These documents are apart of a larger web of documents that I use to navigate my work.
For myself, I've also link the private navigation point: [private-repos](https://github.com/tbrumbaugh5396/tbrumbaugh5396-private-index)

## 📚 Naming Conventions

The naming conventions for repositories are as follows:

- Uppercase letters are used to separate words in navigation repos that only contain a README and no code
- Otherwise, the repo name should be in all lowercase letters and use snake_case, with hyphens used to separate words
- All repos should be in the github folder on my computer
- All folders should match the repo name

## 🧭 How to Use This Profile

- Each repository has a focused scope and an explanatory README.
- Repositories are grouped by **conceptual domain**, not just technology.
- Some work is exploratory and evolving — that is intentional.
- Private repositories exist for unfinished or sensitive work.

This README is meant to function as a **map**, not a marketing page.
However, may transition to a marketing page as this matures and later a website.
