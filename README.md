# Hi, I’m Thomas 👋

I work on software, mathematics, and systems-level models at the intersection of
computer science, economics, and machine intelligence.

This GitHub profile is a **central navigation point** for my public work.

These documents are apart of a larger web of documents that I use to navigate my work.
For myself, I've also link the private navigation point: [private-repos](https://github.com/tbrumbaugh5396/tbrumbaugh5396-private-index)

## 🧭 How to Use This Profile

- Each repository has a focused scope and an explanatory README.
- Repositories are grouped by **conceptual domain**, not just technology.
- Some work is exploratory and evolving — that is intentional.
- Private repositories exist for unfinished or sensitive work.

This README is meant to function as a **map**, not a marketing page.
However, may transition to a marketing page as this matures and later a website.
